# Write Number in Expanded Form

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in [Expanded Form](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/expanded-notation.html). For example:

```haskell
expandedForm 12    -- Should return '10 + 2'
expandedForm 42    -- Should return '40 + 2'
expandedForm 70304 -- Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'
```


expanded_form(12) # Should return '10 + 2'
expanded_form(42) # Should return '40 + 2'
expanded_form(70304) # Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'
