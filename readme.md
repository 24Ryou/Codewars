# Codewars Solution
i wrote a app that organize my codewars solutions base on their 'rank'
you could find kata that i completed in katas folder
if you like have full view on what kata i've done, there is a link.txt in 'app' folder that sort all katas link + their names on it!
the main language is python ,  i recently add some php on my old solution, if there was any new solution by new language i added to the
kata by 'solution.typelanguage" ex: solution.js or solution.php,
for testing my code in python i use codewars_test, make sure setup that if you want have local env for testing your kata befor attempt,
and for php i wrote a phpunit and use unitest package.
katas folder contain all of the kata i done so far and i do the updating every friday if it possible!
