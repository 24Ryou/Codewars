# Codewars Solution
codewars.md contains all of my solution base on python language, also i create a makrdown generator for any kata that i answered so i could keep track of all challenge with solution in case some day i use to go to that challenge for answer by diffrent language, and also i was new to api so it was a good practice both with python and api and files.

for testing my code i use codewars_test
challenges folder contain all of the challenge i done so far and i do the updating every friday if it possible!
