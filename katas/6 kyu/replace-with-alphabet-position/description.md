Welcome.

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

`"a" = 1`, `"b" = 2`, etc.

## Example <!-- unlisted languages will use the first entry. please keep python up top. -->

```python
alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
```

alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
