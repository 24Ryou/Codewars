  "description": "A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.\n\nEach segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:\n\n```\n11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010\n (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)\n```\n\nshould become:\n\n```\n10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111\n (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)\n```\n\nThe total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.\n\nThe data is given in an array as such:\n\n```\n[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]\n```\n\nNote: In the C and NASM languages you are given the third parameter which is the number of segment blocks.",
