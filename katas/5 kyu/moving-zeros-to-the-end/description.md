# Moving Zeros To The End
Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

```php
moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
```

move_zeros([1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3]) # returns [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0]
