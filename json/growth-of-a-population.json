  "description": "In a small town the population is `p0 = 1000` at the beginning of a year. The population\nregularly increases by `2 percent` per year and moreover `50` new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. \nHow many years does the town need to see its population\ngreater or equal to `p = 1200` inhabitants?\n\n```\nAt the end of the first year there will be: \n1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants\n\nAt the end of the 2nd year there will be: \n1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)\n\nAt the end of the 3rd year there will be:\n1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213\n\nIt will need 3 entire years.\n```\nMore generally given parameters:\n\n`p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to surpass)`\n\nthe function `nb_year` should return `n` number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to `p`.\n\naug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)\n\n```\nExamples:\nnb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15\nnb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10\n```\n\n#### Note: \nDon't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.\n\n",
