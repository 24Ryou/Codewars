  "description": "A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building.\nThe height of this floor, *h*, is known. \n\nHe drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).\n \nHis mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.\n\nHow many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling _and_ bouncing?\n\n#### Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:\n\n*  Float parameter \"h\" in meters must be greater than 0\n*  Float parameter \"bounce\" must be greater than 0 and less than 1\n*  Float parameter \"window\" must be less than h.\n\n**If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.**\n\n#### Note:\nThe ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly *greater* than the window parameter.\n\n#### Examples:\n```\n- h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3\n\n- h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 \n\n(Condition 2) not fulfilled).\n```",
