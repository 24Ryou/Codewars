  "description": "Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.\n\nThe function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns `\"now\"`. Otherwise,  the duration is expressed as a combination of `years`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes` and `seconds`.\n\nIt is much easier to understand with an example:\n\n```text\n* For seconds = 62, your function should return \n    \"1 minute and 2 seconds\"\n* For seconds = 3662, your function should return\n    \"1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds\"\n```\n\n**For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours.**\n\nNote that spaces are important.\n\n\n### Detailed rules\n\nThe resulting expression is made of components like `4 seconds`, `1 year`, etc.  In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.\n\nThe components are separated by a comma and a space (`\", \"`). Except the last component, which is separated by `\" and \"`, just like it would be written in English. \n\nA more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant one. Therefore, `1 second and 1 year` is not correct, but `1 year and 1 second` is.\n\nDifferent components have different unit of times. So there is not repeated units like in `5 seconds and 1 second`.\n\nA component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero.  Hence, `1 minute and 0 seconds` is not valid, but it should be just `1 minute`.\n\n A unit of time must be used \"as much as possible\". It means that the function should not return `61 seconds`, but `1 minute and 1 second` instead.  Formally, the duration specified by  of a component must not be greater than any valid more significant unit of time.\n",
